# Testimony and Memory: The Holocaust in Literature and Film

Today, the remaining survivors of the Holocaust who are able to share their stories were children in the 1940s, and in the next decade many of them will pass away. Without living memory of the Holocaust, our understanding of this event depends increasingly on historical accounts, published testimonies, oral histories, literature, and film. This course will investigate representations of the Holocaust, while considering larger questions of what it means to bear witness to and memorialize traumatic events. Through first-person testimonies, films, and literature, we will study antisemitism and the rise of National Socialism in 1930s Germany and Austria, the experience of emigration and exile, ghettos and camps, Jewish resistance, and trials after the war’s end. Last, we discuss how Germany and other countries are grappling with questions of race, memory, and responsibility as they work through and commemorate histories of genocide. Core texts of the course will include German-language literary works, and both dramatic and documentary films. In German. May be taken after German 301. Students may repeat 430 and 490 (with different topics) in consultation with the department. Course may be counted towards the Jewish Studies concentration.

## Course Objectives:

By the end of this course you will:
 - acquire the necessary vocabulary and structures to discuss the historical context of the Holocaust, and why, how, where, when the Holocaust took place
 - reflect on the role of testimony, literature, and film, and be able to critically analyze issues of Holocaust representation in various media
 - understand the importance of precise terminology when discussing the Holocaust
 - develop your writing abilities across a wide array of styles and genres (e.g. online forums,
critical essays)
 - develop your speaking skills through active participation in class discussions, oral presentations, and frequent group activities

 **Content Disclaimer:** The material in this course will at times be upsetting and disturbing. I am committed to creating a safe space for learning. If you ever need to step outside the classroom, you may do so. Please contact me if you have any specific concerns.

### Online Dictionaries and Dictionary Apps

As a more advanced German student, you should be using a German-German dictionary such as [Duden](https://www.duden.de) or [Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache](https://dwds.de), as well as checking several German-English dictionaries to ensure you have the correct word when using a translator (ex: [leo](https:/dict.leo.org) or [Deutsch-Englisch-Wörterbuch](https://dict.cc)). I also recommend [Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache](https://dwds.de) for checking usage and finding examples.

## Assignments and Expectations

### Attendance
The health and safety of our community is the biggest priority in this pandemic. **You should not attend class if you are ill and are symptomatic (fever, cough, etc).** You will not be penalized for absences due to sickness, and I will **not** ask for formal documentation. I hope that you will use your best judgment if you are feeling ill or may have been exposed, to protect others.

In the event of illness or COVID-related absence:
 - Please notify me in advance, if possible. This helps me to plan and also support you.
 - Keep up with coursework as much as possible.
 - Participate in our seminar activities and submit assignments electronically as much as
possible.
 - Contact me to discuss alternative due dates or modifications to assignments.

When you are not ill, I expect regular, consistent attendance and participation. In a seminar-style course, there is no real replacement for in-class discussion and engagement with your peers and instructor. If you miss substantial portions of the class, it may not be possible to earn course credit.

### Participation
Participation = course engagement. You should **participate actively** by contributing to class discussions, taking notes, annotating your texts, and engaging fully during group activities. While you are encouraged to speak often, please be aware of your role within the classroom. If you tend to be a quieter student, consider ways that you can contribute more to the class discussions. If you tend to be more vocal, consider when it would be opportune to let others speak. You may also show your active participation by attending office hours, submitting written notes or emails, etc. At the end of the term you will fill out a self-assessment about your participation in the course.

**A note on seminar etiquette:** It is important that we all respect the perspectives of others in the seminar. This includes not only comments made in class and on virtual learning platforms, but also actively listening to the viewpoints of fellow students, allowing others to speak without interrupting, and always having your phone and other distractions put away during our class meetings.

### Homework Assignments

Homework primarily includes readings, online posts, question sheets, and vocabulary and grammar exercises. It is your responsibility to **complete and submit this work by the beginning of class on the assigned date.** Make sure to also have this work with you in class, as we will often review it together. You should **expect to spend approximately 2-3 hours on homework and preparation for each class session.** Please contact me if you feel you are working more than this amount. 

### Vocabulary Exercises (included in “Homework” grade)
For most class sessions, you will have an assigned vocabulary set to study on Quizlet. Make your free account and register to the class Quizlet site (link via Moodle). When you have vocab sets due, you must complete two exercises (“learn” and one other task) for the assigned vocabulary. For full credit, these two exercises must be completed by the beginning of each assigned class session

### Referate: Oral Presentations
Students will present once orally during the quarter on a chosen author or theme. More information will be handed out early in the term. Expectations will vary for students in GERM 490.

### Writing Assignments
You will have **two extended writing assignments** throughout the term. For each paper, you will receive feedback and a grade. Based on these comments, you will correct your own errors and **submit a revision** (alongside the original). You can improve your initial grade half a letter grade through the revision process. [Essay expectations will vary slightly for **GERM 490** students.]
 - **No late writing assignments will be accepted without prior permission**
 - **Double-space all typed assignments** so I can easily make corrections
 - Always **include the word count** at the end (excluding heading)

 ### Final Project
 For the final project you will have the option between a more traditional essay, or a creative project. More information will be given later in the term. It will be turned in virtually. **No in-person final.**

 ### Co-Curricular Activities
 Co-curricular activities organized by faculty and TAs complement our class work and are part of your attendance/participation grade. Students in German 430/490 are required to attend at least three co-curricular events a term. You may of course attend more! Two of the activities should be department-sponsored events, such as Stammtisch or film screenings, and one can be an activity of your own design. 2% deducted from Attendance and Participation for each missing activity at the end of the quarter. Special events in winter term:
  - Info Abend: Majoring/Minoring in German, Monday, Jan. 24

### Academic Honesty
Academic honesty is a critical part of our value system at K. When you borrow an idea, express the idea in your own words, thus thinking it through and making it your own, and acknowledge the source of the idea in a note, or, in certain situations, use the exact words of the source in quotation marks and acknowledge with a note.

### What counts as "cheating" in a language course? How do I use online tools and language resources correctly?

| Acceptable | Unacceptable |
|:--- |:---|
| Ask a peer 3-4 specific questions about your assignment. | Have a peer or TA re-write a paragraph or paper.|
|Use an expression or phrase from the textbook in your own work.|Copy out complex sentences or paragraphs from another source and claim it as your own work.|
|Ask your professor specific questions on how to say something.|Have a native speaker, friend, or peer proofread your essay. |
|Use an online translator for single words or short phrases (although be careful!)|Use an online translator to translate a sentence or paragraph.|
|Use an online dictionary to check noun gender, or plural forms, or verb conjugations (please do!!).|Copying an English text and having it translated into German|
|Use an outside source with citation.|Use outside sources without citing|
|Work with a classmate on an assignment. (Please note this on the assignment if you do so. This is not acceptable for essays.)|Have a classmate do your assignment, or work with a group without acknowledging you did so|

It is easy for language instructors to detect the use of online translators or native-speaker proofreaders. All violations of academic integrity will be investigated and determined by the course instructor, after which the case may be referred to the Dean of Students for possible disciplinary action.

I look forward to working with you this term. If you have any other questions or concerns, please contact me. I always welcome student feedback on the course materials, workload, assignments throughout the course to help support student learning.

I wish you all a productive winter term 2022!
